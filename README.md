# ElFramo (3)

ElFramo is a simple but powerful unit frame addon able to provide a clean unit frame setup with heavily customisable ways to track buffs, debuffs, and more. This addon was initially created for personal use, hence a potential lack of 'common' features that I did not need for myself  (such as Clique support, heal predictions or easy previews).


## Features

* An simple interface with many options
* Very lightweight (as long as you dont go crazy with silly custom settings)
* Allows multiple layouts of unit frames active at the same time (niche but neat)
* Can track single auras, or white/blacklists that expand automatically
* Load elements on specific classes or roles, and in specific instances
* Sort elements in groups for a clean customization interface
* Track incoming enemy casts with whitelists on your frames (needs visible nameplates for non-boss casts)
* Track unit chat messages on your frames(niche but neat)

## Usage

Open the options window by typing `/ef3` in your chat and then enter


## Documentation

Hopefully coming soon.
